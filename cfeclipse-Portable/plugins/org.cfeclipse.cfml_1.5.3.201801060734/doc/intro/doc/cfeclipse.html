<h1>An Eclipse Plugin for CFML</h1>
<p>Founded in February 2004, the goal of the CFEclipse project is to create a plugin for the Eclipse platform that provides a professional quality IDE for CFML developers. Currently the CFEclipse plugin is one of the top rated Eclipse plugins at <a href="http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/" title="Eclipse Plugin Central">Eclipse Plugin Central</a> and is in use by developers across the globe. CFEclipse offers most of the features found in traditional CFML editors and quite a few more that they don't. As well as allowing developers to take advantage of the wealth of other Eclipse plugins, CFEclipse comes with a developer friendly price tag...&nbsp; It's <strong>FREE</strong>!</p>

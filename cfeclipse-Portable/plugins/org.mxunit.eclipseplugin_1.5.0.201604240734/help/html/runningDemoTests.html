<h1>Running Demo Tests</h1>
<p>
The MXUnit framework distribution comes with a directory named "PluginDemoTests". These are a set of tests designed to showcase various functionality in this Plugin. They are NOT meant in any way as an example of how to write test!
</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> This assumes you have configured a project in Eclipse for the MXunit framework. The plugin cannot run tests that are not part of configured Eclipse projects.</p>
<p>
<b>To run the tests</b>
<ol>
<li>Open the MXUnit View
<li>Click the "Search" icon (or hit CTRL-F)
<li>type "PluginDemoTests". Click OK
<li>It'll take a few seconds to start up if this is the first time running the
tests. 
	<ol>
	
	<li>You'll then get an eclipse Error. This is expected, 
because InvalidMarkupTest.cfc is a bad file.
	<li>Click OK on the error message.
	<li>Each of the test cases in the entire directory of tests will load
	 into the tree. It does not run the tests.
	 
	 </ol>
<li>Click the green "Play" button (or hit Enter)
<li>The tests will run. 
<li>To see any output from the tests, right click in the tree and select 
"Open test case results in browser". or hit "F8". or hit "b".
<li>To run all tests again, hit the green play arrow
<li>To run just the failures, hit the red play arrow
<li>To show just the failures in the tree, click the "Filter" icon in the view, or hit "f". Hit "f" again to unfilter.
<li>To clear all results, click the "refresh" icon or hit "F5"
</ol>

<h1>Test Suites</h1>
<p>The plugin does not support running TestSuites. In fact, MXUnit believes in the concept of &quot;Implicit Suites&quot;. Rather than requiring you to add TestCase components into a suite, MXUnit instead treats all files named &quot;Test*.cfc&quot; or &quot;*Test.cfc&quot; as a test case. </p>
<p>Consequently, if you have a directory of components, and there's SomeTest.cfc in there, you can right click on the directory, select &quot;Run MXUnit Tests&quot;, and it'll run just that SomeTest.cfc and ignore all the other files. This unique behavior essentially renders suites useless.</p>

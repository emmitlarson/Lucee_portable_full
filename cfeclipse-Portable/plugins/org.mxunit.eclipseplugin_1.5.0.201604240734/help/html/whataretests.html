 <h1>How does the plugin know which files are tests? </h1>
 <p>MXUnit treats all files named &quot;Test*.cfc&quot; or &quot;*Test.cfc&quot; as a test case. If you have a project with 1000 files in it, and you right click on the project and select &quot;Run MXUnit Tests&quot;, it'll cherrypick just the Test components and run those tests. MXUnit does not expect or enforce any directory conventions. </p>
 <p>This means you can store your tests in separate directories, or you can store your tests along-side the components under test. The plugin will find just the tests and igore the rest.</p>

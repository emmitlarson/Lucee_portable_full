<h1>Project-Specific RemoteFacade URL</h1>
<p>Pointing a project at a custom RemoteFacade URL involves two simple steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create the new RemoteFacade.cfc</li>
  <li>Point your project properties to the new URL</li>
</ol>
<h2>How</h2>
<h3>	Creating the new RemoteFacade.cfc</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a New CFC. Put it wherever. Name it whatever.
  <li>Set the "extends" attribute of the component tag to "mxunit.Framework.RemoteFacade"
  <li>Ensure you can access the wsdl for the file in a browser. For example, if you created c:\inetpub\wwwroot\myproject\RemoteFacade.cfc, try hitting http://localhost/myproject/RemoteFacade.cfc?wsdl
</ol>
<h3>Pointing your project properties to the new URL</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Right click on the project name in the Navigator or Project Explorer
  <li>Select "Properties"
  <li>Select "MXUnit Properties"
  <li>Add the path to your custom remote URL
    <ul>
      <li>NOTE: if you're just using this to point to an mxunit install on a different port, then you can skip the "/mxunit/framework/RemoteFacade.cfc" part of the URL. Just use http://localhost:8888, for example. In that case, the plugin will suffix your url with "mxunit/framework/RemoteFacade.cfc"</li>
  </ul>  
</ol>
<h2>Example #1: Creating a custom RemoteFacade.cfc for your project which tests CF ORM / Hibernate Components</h2>
<p>In your project, create a file named RemoteFacade.cfc and give it this content:</p>

<div style="color:blue">
<xmp>
<cfcomponent extends="mxunit.framework.RemoteFacade">
</cfcomponent>
</xmp>
</div>
<p>Right click on your project and set the RemoteFacade URL property to point to the URL for this new component</p>
<p>Now, all calls to your tests <strong>for this project</strong> will route through this RemoteFacade.cfc. Since your project also has an Application.cfc, that means that everything from your Application.cfc will apply</p>





<h2>Example #2: Creating a custom RemoteFacade.cfc for your project and including custom behavior for every test case</h2>
<p>Follow the same steps as above</p>
<p>In your new RemoteFacade.cfc, implement the actOnTestCase method to peform whatever behavior you would like for each test case. Here's an example:</p>

<div style="color:blue">
<xmp>
<cfcomponent extends="mxunit.framework.RemoteFacade">

	<cffunction name="actOnTestCase">
		<cfargument name="TestCase">
		
		<cfif findNoCase("TestManager.Retail",GetMetadata(TestCase).name)>
			<cfinclude template="retail/Application.cfm">		
		<cfelse>
			<cfinclude template="enrollment/Application.cfm">
		</cfif>
	</cffunction>
	

</cfcomponent>
</xmp>
</div>


</body>
</html>

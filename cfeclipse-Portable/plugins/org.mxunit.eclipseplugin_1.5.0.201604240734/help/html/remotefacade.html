<title>RemoteFacade URL Basics</title>

<h1>RemoteFacade URL Basics</h1>


<p>This plugin works by making soap (i.e. webservice) calls to a URL. By default, that URL is to a RemoteFacade.cfc that 
comes bundled with the MXUnit framework. This component acts as a "bridge" between Eclipse and ColdFusion by exposing methods which the plugin will use to communicate with ColdFusion.
</p>
<p><b>You do not put tests in the RemoteFacade!</b></p>
<p>When you first installed the plugin, it made a reasonable attempt at 
guessing the location of this Remote URL, but more than likely it guessed wrong... so you'll need to set it up correctly. </p>
<h2>How</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Window -- Preferences -- MXUnit</li>
  <li>Check and correct the URL if necessary. For example, maybe it currently reads "http://localhost/mxunit/framework/RemoteFacade.cfc" </li>
  but your CF installation is at localhost:8501. Change the URL accordingly.
</ol>
<h2>Overriding the URL for special cases</h2>
<p> There are times when your project won't be able to point to the URL you have configured in the global preferences:
<ul>
  <li>You need custom remote functionality for the tests in a certain project. For example, you need the RemoteFacade.cfc to include a custom Application.cfm file for every test</li>
  <li>Your tests need to run under the context of your project's Application.cfc:</li>
  	<ul>  	
	  <li>Your tests, or objects under test, access Application or Session scoped variables.</li>
	  <li>You're testing components that use ColdFusion's built-in Hibernate ORM. </li>
  	</ul>
  <li>You need some custom behavior to occur for <em>each test case</em> in a certain project</li>
</ul>
In these cases, you'll need to <a href="project-specific-remotefacade.html">override the RemoteFacade URL at the project level</a>.
